# ProTrekkr

This a fork of a fork of ProTrekkr. 

Lots of code will be ripped out. Tears will be shed.

Some ideas:

- reorganize folder structure
- reduce global variables 
- remove unneeded features
- samplerates other that 44.1 kHz
- lua API 
- Sporth plugin
- more internal effects
- Conversion to C99 (code isn't really c++ anyways)


This repo contains a fork of ProTrekkr, now with linux JACK Audio support.
